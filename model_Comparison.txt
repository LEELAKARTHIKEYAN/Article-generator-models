Key Metrics for Evaluation
-Grammar Errors: Indicates the grammatical correctness of the generated text. Fewer errors are better.
-Readability Score: Measures the ease of reading the generated text (higher scores indicate easier readability).
-Word Count: Represents the verbosity and coverage of the generated text. An appropriate word count contributes to better content quality.
-Perplexity: Reflects how well the model predicts text. Lower perplexity indicates better performance and coherence.
